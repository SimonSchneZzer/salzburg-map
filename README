Museums & Exhibitions in Salzburg – Web Map
Run the project with: "python3 -m http.server"

This web application displays cultural locations in Salzburg, including museums, galleries, memorials, and cultural centers. It is designed for tourists and built using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap data.

Features
	•	Interactive map centered on Salzburg
	•	Category-specific markers with consistent coloring
	•	Clustered markers based on zoom level and location density
	•	Popups showing name, description, address, hours, website, and accessibility
	•	Toggleable layers for different categories

Technologies Used
	•	Leaflet (interactive map)
	•	Leaflet.markercluster (marker clustering)
	•	OpenStreetMap and Overpass Turbo (data source)
	•	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

How It Works
	•	index.html loads Leaflet and clustering libraries, adds the map container, and links to styles and scripts
	•	script.js initializes the map, loads GeoJSON data, processes categories, creates markers and clusters, and adds popups
	•	style.css provides a black-and-white theme with colored markers and styled clusters

data/cultural_locations.geojson
